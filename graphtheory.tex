\chapter{Lecture 1: Basic Notions}

\section{Preliminaries and notation}

The substructure of the majority of modern mathematics is set theory. It
therefore would behoove us to take a very slight digression into some
useful concepts and notations.

\begin{defn}
A \Xb{set} is a collection of elements, is defined exactly by its elements.
Two sets are equal if they contain the same elements.
\end{defn}

\begin{notn}
We will denote a set using ``set notation.'' This consists of listing the
elements of a set enclosed in braces, and separated by commas. Note that
the order in which elements are written doesen't change the set. For
example $\{a, b, c\} = \{b, c, a\}$.
\end{notn}

\begin{defn}
For a set $S$, its \Xb{power set} $\ms P(S)$, is the set whose
elements are the subsets of $S$
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
For a set $S$, we let $\ms P_k(S)$ denote its subsets with exactly $k$
elements.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
For sets $S, T$ we let $S \times T$ denote the set whose elements are
ordered pairs $(s, t)$ where $s \in S$ and $t \in T$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
A \Xb{multiset} $\ms S$ is a pair $(S, m)$, where $S$ is a set, and $m$ is a
function $m: S \to \mathbb Z_{> 0}$ from $S$ to the positive integers. For
$s \in S$, we refer to $m(s)$ as the multiplicity of $s$ in $\ms S$. We
write $s \in \ms S$. We call $S$ the underlying set of $\ms S$.

For a multiset $\ms S = (S, m)$, we will use the notation $m_{\ms S}$ to
refer to $m$.
\end{defn}

\begin{notn}
We will write a multiset $S$ by writing a list of its elements, with
repetition, in a string, each elements arising in the string as many times
as it its multiplicity. The order in which the elements are written
doesen't matter. For example, $abbbcc = abcbcb$.
\end{notn}

\begin{defn}
Let $\ms S$ and $\ms T$ be multisets. We say that $\ms S \subset \ms T$ if
the underlying set of $\ms S$ is contained in the underlying set of $\ms
T$.
\end{defn}

If $S$ is a set, we will also identify $S$ with the multiset $(S, m)$
defined by $m(s) = 1$ for each $s \in S$ (that is, $S$ contains each of its
elements exactly $1$ time).

These mutisets are occasionally useful in combinatorics to think of the
idea of sampling with replacement/repetition.

\begin{defn}
If $\ms S = (S, m)$ is a multiset, we define the \Xb{cardinality} of $\ms
S$, denoted  $\#\ms S$, to be
\[ \sum_{s \in S} m(s). \]
\end{defn}
In particular, considering a set $T$ as a multiset as described above, we
have $\# T$ is exactly the number of elements of $T$.

\begin{defn} \label{multisubsets definition}
Let $S$ be a set. We write $\ms R(S)$ to denote the set of all mulisubsets
of $S$, and $\ms R_k(S)$ the set of all multisubsets of $S$ with
cardinality exactly $S$.
\end{defn}


\section{Graphs}
Graphs encode the idea of connections between things, for example
\begin{itemize}
\item networks of computers
\item people and their relationships
\item cities and highways
\item sets and intersections
\item workers and tasks
\end{itemize}


In formal mathematical terms, a graph is:
\begin{defn}
A \Xb{graph} $G$ is an ordered triple $(V, E, \psi)$ consisting of
\begin{itemize}
\item a set $V$, whose elements are referred to as vertices,
\item a set $E$, whose elements are referred to as edges, and
\item an ``incidence'' function $\psi: E \to \ms R_2(V)$,
\end{itemize}
where $\ms R_2(V)$ is the set of unordered pairs of elements of $V$ (which
one may also think of as two elements multisubsets of $V$ -- see
Definition~\ref{multisubsets definition}).
\end{defn}

PICTURES AND EXAMPLES HERE

\begin{notn}
For a graph $G = (V, E, \psi)$ we write $V_G$ for $V$, $E_G$ for $E$ and
$\psi_G$ for $\psi$.
\end{notn}
In other words, using this notational convention, if we are given graphs
$G, H, K$, and have not specified letters for their sets of vertices,
edges, etcetera, we may write, for example, $E_K$ for the edges of the
graph $K$, $V_H$ for the vertices of $H$, and $\psi_G$ for the incidence
function of $G$.

\begin{defn}
Let $G$ be a graph, $e \in E_G$ an edge and $v \in V_G$ a vertex. We say
that $e$ and $v$ are \Xb{incident} if $v \in \psi(e)$.
\end{defn}

DIAGRAM

\begin{defn}
Let $G$ be a graph. If $e \in E_G$ is an edge, we say that $e$ is a
\Xb{loop}, if $e$ is incident to exactly one vertex.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
We say that $G$ is a \Xb{simple graph} if
\begin{itemize}
\item $G$ has no loops,
\item there is at most $1$ edge incident to any pair of vertices.
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}
Note that the second condition is the same as requiring that the function
$\psi_G$ be one-to-one.

Graphs can be drawn in many different ways:

\begin{defn}
$G$ is called a \Xb{planar graph} if it may be drawn in the plane with no
edges crossing.
\end{defn}

\section{Real world graph problems}

\subsection{Scheduling}
\begin{itemize}
\item vertices = jobs that need to be done
\item edges = jobs which require conflicting resources
\end{itemize}
problem: how to decide how many ``periods of work'' needed to complete
all jobs.

Similar problem: table arrangements at a wedding
\begin{itemize}
\item vertices = guests
\item edges = guest that don't get along
\end{itemize}
problem: how many tables?

translation: vertex colorings, chromatic number of a graph

\subsection{Tournaments}

various teams need to play each other. disjoint pairs of teams can play
simultaneously, but of course the same team can't play at the same time.
How many rounds are needed for teams to play each other?
\begin{itemize}
\item vertices = teams
\item edges = teams who need to play each other
\end{itemize}
problem: how many rounds?

\section{The rationale behind the language}

The choice of thinking of a graph as a triple $G = (V, E, \psi)$ has its
advantages and disadvantages. If we were only concerned with simple graphs,
we could have simplified our notation somewhat by omitting the function
$\psi$, and letting $E$ itself be a subset of the set of 
unordered pairs of distinct elements of $V$. In the case of general graphs,
however, where there can be multiple edges between two vertices, this is
somewhat less convenient. We could persist with this approach by saying
that $E$ be a multisubset instead of a subset, however, this is a little
bit less convenient later when we wish to talk about colorings or
labellings of edges.

An alternate way of defining things could be as follows: Instead of
defining the function $\psi$ as the fundamental concept, one may instead
define the notion of \textbf{adjacency} as the fundamental concept as
follows:

\begin{defn}
A griph $G$ is an ordered triple $(V, E, \alpha)$ consisting of a set of
vertices $V$, a set of edges $E$, and a set of ordered pairs $\alpha
\subset V \times E$ such that
\item for every $e \in E$, there is at least one, and at most two elements
$v \in V$ such that $(v, e) \in \alpha$. If $(v, e) \in \alpha$, we say
that $v$ is incident to $e$. A griph is called simple if every edge is
adjacent to exactly two vertices.
\end{defn}

\begin{exercise}
Show that griphs are exactly in correspondence with graphs in such a way
that the relationship of incidence lines up.
\end{exercise}

\chapter{Lecture 2: Digraphs and degree formulas}
\section{Directed graphs}

A variation on the notion of a graph is also very useful both theoretically
and in applications:

\begin{defn}
A \Xb{directed graph} or \Ab{digraph}{digraph|see {directed graph}} $D$ is an
ordered triple $(V, A, \psi)$ where $V$ is a set, referred to as the
\textbf{vertices} of $D$, a set $A$ referred to as the \Xb{arrows} of $D$,
and a pair of functions $s, t: A \to V$, taking arrows to
elements of $V$.
\end{defn}

\begin{notn}
For a digraph $D = (V, A, \psi)$, as before, we write $V_D$ for $V$, $A_D$
for $A$, $s_D$ for $s$, and $t_D$ for $t$.
\end{notn}

\begin{notn}
For a digraph $D$, and an arrow $a \in A_D$, we call $s(a)$ the
\Ab{source}{source (of an arrow)} of $a$ and $t(a)$ the \Ab{target}{target
(of an arrow)} of $a$.
\end{notn}

EXAMPLES:
\begin{itemize}
\item one way street maps
\item irreversible processes
\item dependencies: e.g. scheduling with dependencies
\end{itemize}

\newcommand{\outdeg}{\oper{outdeg}}
\newcommand{\indeg}{\oper{indeg}}

\begin{defn}
Let $D$ be a digraph. For a vertex $v$, we define the \Xb{outdegree} of
$v$, denoted $\outdeg v$, to be the number of edges whose source is $v$,
and the \Xb{indegree} of $v$, denoted $\indeg v$, to be the number of edges
whose target is $v$.
Formall, we have
\[ \outdeg v = \#\{a \in A_D \mid  s(a) = v\} ,\ \ 
\indeg v = \#\{a \in A_D \mid t(a) = v\}.
\]
If it is necessary to specify the digraph, we may also write $\outdeg_D(v)$
or $\indeg_D(v)$.
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}[The degree formula for digraphs]
Suppose that $D$ is a digraph. Then 
\[\sum_{v \in V_D} \outdeg(v) = \sum_{v \in V_D} \indeg(v) = \#A_D.\]
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Informally, this is clear for the following reason: every arrow in $A_D$
has its source at exactly one vertex, and so contributes exactly $1$ to the
first sum, and every arrow has its target at exactly one vertex and
similarly contributes exactly once to the second sum.

Let us, however, for the sake of practice, give a more formal argument:
\[\sum_{v \in V_D} \outdeg(v) = \sum_{v \in V_D} \sum_{a \in A_D, s(a) = v}
1 = \sum_{(v, a) \in V_D \times A_D, s(a) = v} 1 \]
But now, let us notice that the pairs $(v, a)$ with $s(a) = v$ are in
bijection with simply the set $A_D$, since by the description, $v$ is
determined by $a$. Therefore, we may rewrite this as:
\[\sum_{(v, a) \in V_D \times A_D, s(a) = v} 1  = \sum_{a \in A_D} 1 =
\#A_D.\]
The rest of the proof follows in an analogous way.

\end{proof}

\section{From graphs to digraphs}

Given a graph $G$, we may construct a digraph $dig(G)$ by definining
\begin{itemize}
\item $V_{dig(G)} = V_G$,
\item $A_{dig(G)} = \{(v, e) \in V \times E | v \in \psi(e)\}$,
\item $s_{dig(G)}(v, e) = v$, $t_{dig(G)}(v, e) = w$, where $\psi(e) = vw$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{defn}
Suppose that $G$ is a graph. We define the \Xb{degree} of a vertex $v \in
V_G$, denoted $\deg v$ to be the number of edges incident to $v$. If it is
necessary to specify the graph, we may also write $\deg_G v$.
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}[The degree formula for graphs]
Suppose that $G$ is any graph. Then we have
\[\sum_{v \in V_G} \deg v = 2\#E.\]
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Intuitively, one way to see this is that if we chop each edge in the
middle, making two ``half edges'' for every edge, then each half edge is
incident to exactly one vertex, and contritutes exactly once to the degree
count on the left.

More formally, if we let $dig(G)$ be the associated digraph to $G$, then we
note that for every edge of $G$, there are two arrows of $dig(G)$. Also,
for every edge $e$ incident to $v$, there is exactly one arrow, which we
call $(v, e)$ which starts at $e$. That is, the map
\begin{align*}
\{e \in E_G | \text{$e$ is incident to $v$}\} &\to \{a \in A_{dig(G)} | s(a)
= v\} \\
e \mapsto (v, e) 
\end{align*}
is a bijection (its inverse being given by $(v, e) \mapsto e$). In
particular, this says that $\outdeg_{dig(G)} v = \deg_G v$.

By the
degree formula for digraphs, we therefore have
\[\sum_{v \in V_G} \deg_G v = \sum_{v \in A_{dig(G)}} \outdeg_{dig(G)} v =
\#A_{dig(G)} = 2\#E_G\]
as desired.
\end{proof}

A surprising conclusion here is that the sum of the degrees of the vertices
of a graph must be even! 

\chapter{Lecture 2.5: Specific Graphs, Subgraphs, Isomorphisms}

\begin{defn}
The \Xb{complete graph} on $n$ vertices, denoted $K_n$ is the simple graph
with vertices consisting of the set $\{1, \ldots, n\}$, edges consisting of
the set of unordered pairs 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
Let $G$ be a graph. We say that a graph $H$ is a \Xb{subgraph} of a graph $G$ if
$V_H \subset V_G$, $E_H \subset E_G$ and $\psi_H = \psi_G|_{E_H}$.
\end{defn}

Given a graph $G$, we will often want to understand its structure by
looking at which subgraphs it has, and their properties.
