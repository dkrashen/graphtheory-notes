\section{Other basic notions} \label{other basic notions section}

For a graph $G$, we let $v(G) = \#V_G$ denote the number of vertices of
$G$, and $e(G) = \#E_G$ denote the number of edges of $G$. We let
$\delta(G)$ denote the mininum degree of a vertex of $G$, and $\Delta(G)$
denote the maximum degree of a vertex.
